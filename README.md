A light-weight but Robust Django web application designed to facilitate price comparison for a wide range of electronics products available in Ethiopia.

As a Specialization Portfolio Project for ALX Software Engineering Program/Holberton School, this web app showcases my expertise in web development and demonstrates my ability to tackle complex projects independently. Throughout the development process, which spanned about couple of weeks, I meticulously crafted the app, ensuring its functionality, usability, and security. (Note: Ongoing work is required for continuous improvement.)

This Project endeavors to Empower Ethiopian consumers with the tools to make informed purchasing decisions. In an effort to Streamline the online shopping experience, saving both time and money, this project strives to incorporate Electronics product categories (expanding to all categories in the future), ensuring accurate and relevant comparisons.

## Video Demo



My dynamic Django web application, Wisepenny, is on a mission to revolutionize the way consumers in Ethiopia purchase electronics products.

## Challenges:

- In the dynamic Ethiopian electronics market, online pricing variations are common, and language complexities pose unique challenges.
- Wisepenny bridges these gaps, offering consumers the ability to make informed choices and save money.
- It streamlines the online shopping experience, addressing market complexities head-on.

## Journey:

As a solo developer on this project, I poured my passion and dedication into creating a solution that would make a meaningful impact in the electronics consumers sector. Throughout the development process, I embraced a human-centered approach, always keeping in mind the end-users â€“ the buyers who rely on this system to make informed purchasing decisions.
The journey to build WisePenny was filled with both triumphs and struggles. I meticulously planned the project timeline, leveraging tools like Trello to track progress and set deadlines. However, I faced technical complexities and design challenges that required thoughtful problem-solving and perseverance. Despite the hurdles, I remained committed to delivering a high-quality solution.

## Limitations:

### Focus on Electronics: Rationale for Limited Product Category

The present system confines its analytical purview to the fundamental domain of price comparison, particularly within the realm of electronics. This selective approach emanates from a judicious consideration of several pertinent factors:

**Product Availability:** Electronics emerge as an ideal focal point due to their ubiquity and availability within the Ethiopian market. This ensures a robust and comprehensive dataset, facilitating a more meaningful and actionable price comparison.

**Linguistic Complexity:** A significant barrier in expanding the scope to include a broader array of product categories is the predominant use of the Amharic language within various classified platforms. The complexity of Amharic text encoding presents a formidable challenge in the context of efficient data extraction and comparative analysis.

**Price Dynamism:** The system's choice to specialize in electronics is further substantiated by the dynamic nature of pricing patterns within this category. Frequent updates and revisions of product prices by sellers necessitate a responsive and adaptable analytical framework.

**Terminological Precision:** The electronics category lends itself favorably to precise analysis, as sellers demonstrate a proclivity for utilizing technology-specific terminology and nomenclature in their product descriptions and titles. This precision augments the system's ability to provide accurate and contextually relevant price comparisons.

As I reflect on this project, I recognize that there is always room for improvement and growth. In the next iteration, I envision expanding the system's capabilities to include more categories, advanced analytics and reporting tools, integrating Price History Changes functionalities, Product Reviews, Recommendation Algorithms and enhancing the user interface for a seamless user experience.
